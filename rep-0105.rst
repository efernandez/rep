Abstract
========

This REP specifies naming conventions and semantic meaning for
coordinate frames of mobile platforms used with ROS.


Motivation
==========

Developers of drivers, models, and libraries need a share convention
for coordinate frames in order to better integrate and re-use software
components. Shared conventions for coordinate frames provides a
specification for developers creating drivers and models for mobile
bases. Similarly, developers creating libraries and applications can
more easily use their software with a variety of mobile bases that are
compatible with this specification. For example, this REP specifies
the frames necessary for writing a new localization component. It also
specifies frames that can be used to refer to the mobile base of a
robot.


Specification
=============

Coordinate Frames
-----------------

map
'''

The coordinate frame called ``map`` is a world fixed frame, with its
Z-axis pointing upwards. The pose of a mobile platform, relative to
the ``map`` frame, should not significantly drift over time. The
``map`` frame is not continuous, meaning the pose of a mobile platform
in the ``map`` frame can change in discrete jumps at any time.

In a typical setup, a localization component constantly re-computes
the robot pose in the ``map`` frame based on sensor observations,
therefore eliminating drift, but causing discrete jumps when new
sensor information arrives.

The ``map`` frame is useful as a long-term global reference, but
discrete jumps make it a poor reference frame for local sensing and
acting.


odom
''''

The coordinate frame called ``odom`` is a world-fixed frame. The pose
of a mobile platform in the ``odom`` frame can drift over time,
without any bounds. This drift makes the ``odom`` frame useless as a
long-term global reference. However, the pose of a robot in the
``odom`` frame is guaranteed to be continuous, meaning that the pose
of a mobile platform in the ``odom`` frame always evolves in a smooth
way, without discrete jumps.

In a typical setup the ``odom`` frame is computed based on an odometry
source, such as wheel odometry, visual odometry or an inertia
measurement unit.

The ``odom`` frame is useful as an accurate, short-term local
reference, but drift makes is a poor frame for long-term reference.


base_link
'''''''''

The coordinate frame called ``base_link`` is rigidly attached to the
mobile robot base. The ``base_link`` can be attached to the base in
any arbitrary position or orienation; for every hardware platform
there will be a different place on the base that provides an obvious
point of reference. Note that REP 103 [1]_ specifies a preferred
orientation for frames.

earth
'''''

The coordinate frame called ``earth`` is a world fixed frame fixed at
the origin of the earth. (TODO Center of WGS-84 datum? clarify??)
XYZ orientation?

This frame is designed to allow the interaction of multiple robots in different map frames.



Relationship between Frames
---------------------------

We have chosen a tree representation to attach all coordinate frames
in a robot system to each other. Therefore each coordinate frame has
one parent coordinate frame, and any number of child coordinate
frames. The frames described in this REP are attached as follows:

``earth`` --> ``map`` --> ``odom`` --> ``base_link``

The ``map`` frame is the parent of ``odom``, and ``odom`` is the
parent of ``base_link``.  Although intuition would say that both
``map`` and ``odom`` should be attached to ``base_link``, this is not
allowed because each frame can only have one parent.


Frame Authorities
-----------------

The transform from ``odom`` to ``base_link`` is computed and broadcast
by one of the odometry sources.

The transform from ``map`` to ``base_link`` is computed by a
localization component. However, the localization component does not
broadcast the transform from ``map`` to ``base_link``. Instead, it
first receives the transform from ``odom`` to ``base_link``, and uses
this information to broadcast the transform from ``map`` to ``odom``.

The transform from ``earth`` to ``map`` is statically published and
configured by the choice of map frame. If not specifically configured
a fallback position is to use the initial position of the vehicle as
the origin of the map frame. 


Exceptions
----------

The scope of potential robotics software is too broad to require all
ROS software to follow the guidelines of this REP.  However, choosing
different conventions should be well justified and well documented.



Compliance
==========

This REP depends on and is compliant with REP 103 [1]_.
